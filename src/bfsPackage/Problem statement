Given a binary tree, print level order traversal in a way that nodes of all levels are printed in separate lines.

For example consider the following tree:
          1
       /     \
      2       3
    /   \       \
   4     5       6
        /  \     /
       7    8   9

Output for above tree should be
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
